# PassWord_Generator

## Description

A password generator! This webpage is designed to create new passwords revolving around certain criteria.  

At the begining of pressing the genrate password button, there will be screen prompts asking certain questions. The first question is how long or how many characters long the password should be. The next question is wether it should contain lower case characters, then if it should have upper case letters, special characters, and then numbers. If the user does not choose a valid length they will be prompted to try again, if the user does not accept any criteria, they will be propmted to have at least one type of character.  

The password must meet all expectations and it does this by making sure that at least one character of the chosen type is in the password that is generated, otherwise it will generate a new password until all criteria have been met.
